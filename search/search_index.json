Among other things, this upgrade is intended to improve the granularity of measurements and introduce a new and more effective trigger system. Trackers measure the momentum of charged particles. The UT is a tracker placed before particles reach the solenoid. It is the first major controbution to LHCb from the Unites States, and UMD is responsible for the constructing the readout electronics for the UT. The UT plays a role in triggering and long-lived particle reconstruction Overview of sensor and electronics The sensor for the tracker consists of four layers of silicon strips, arranged in a vertical strip called a stave. ASICs digitize the signal from the sensors and send it along 320 Mbps E-links to the PEPI crates. The crates contain DCBs which serialize the data and send that to the DAQ.","title":"UT"},{"location":"#upstream-tracker-ut","text":"The upstream tracker is one of three trackers to be added to the LHCb detector as part of a planned upgrade.
